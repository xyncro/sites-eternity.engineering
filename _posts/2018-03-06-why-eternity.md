title: Why Eternity?
---

In the [first post on this blog][welcome] I briefly touched on the aim of Eternity, to ensure that **"digital doesn't equal ephemeral"**. I want to talk more about that -- to talk about motivation, about the concept of "long term" in the digital world, and about the need for a new approach.

# Technology for People

I'm writing about Eternity in the first person, for two reasons. The first one is simple -- honesty. Eternity needs to be sustainable and I believe that it doesn't require a mega-corp to succeed. The second is the more important -- Eternity is a project for people, and that's personal. Here's why it's personal for me.

Last year I lost my father, a month before the birth of my son. It changed how I think about many things, and permanence is one. Memories I took for granted suddenly were exposed as the fragile and delicate things they are.

Suddenly, as I inherited the thousands of photos my father had taken throughout his life, I started taking photos of my own. In doing so I discovered something -- that the thought of losing them was devastating. While before I had a fleeting and unconsidered relationship with the digital side of my memories, now they were precious in ways I'd never understood.

I hope that nobody else ever learns the same lesson, but I'm human and I know I won't be alone.

# Making Memories Last Forever

This year I started looking at how I create digital memories -- and how I keep them. My iPhone holds moments I couldn't bear to lose. I trust that they're in the cloud somewhere, but how confident do I feel? Photos that my father gave me are on memory sticks or CDs. Memory sticks are fragile, easily lost and soon obsolete. Already I struggle to find a computer to read a CD. Will I still have them in 5 years? 10? 20? How about my son, will he have them in 50?

Other people trust them to social media, hoping that those memories will live on at the pleasure of a company which owes them nothing. How many photos vanished with Friends Reunited? With AOL boards? How many more will vanish with Instagram or Facebook when the next big thing arrives?

Even if I manage to find a way to keep my photos, how many will end up as unreadable ghosts, 78s in a world of streaming and digital playback?

# Towards Digital Permanence

I looked at the cleverest solutions I could find. Peer to peer distributed file systems, blockchain storage, on and on. After a while, I reached a conclusion. The answer is not in the cleverest technologies, but in the organisation charged with keeping digital memories safe -- in its remit, its ethos, in its constitution.

Technology will change over time, with increasing disruption and rapidity. The answer lies not in a new type of technology, but in **a new type of technology company**.

Eternity will be a technology company focused on the long term, making long term decisions and putting resilience, sustainability and risk-aversion ahead of quick profits and exploding user numbers. In many ways, it is as old-fashioned as companies can be, relying on building trust and quietly providing a service of reassurance. It will need to grow, to adapt, to keep pace with the world -- but it will do so **in service of its customers**, not in thrall to disruption and upheaval.

In the next blog post I'll talk more about what I think that looks like practically, about how to use the technologies we have today as a starting point, and how to ensure that a company can live for centuries.
