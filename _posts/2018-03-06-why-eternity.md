# Eternity is a project for People

Last year I lost my father, a month before the birth of my son. It changed how I think about many things, and permanence is one. Memories I took for granted were exposed as the fragile and delicate things they are.

Suddenly, as I inherited the thousands of photos my father had taken throughout his life, I started taking photos of my own. In doing so I discovered something -- that the thought of losing them was devastating. Before I had a fleeting and unconsidered relationship with my digital memories. Now they were precious in ways I'd never understood.

I hope that nobody else ever learns the same lesson, but I'm human and I know I won't be alone.

# Making Memories Last Forever

This year I started looking at how I create digital memories -- and how I keep them. My iPhone holds moments I couldn't bear to lose. I trust that they're in the cloud somewhere, but how confident do I feel? Photos that my father gave me are on memory sticks or CDs. Memory sticks are fragile, easily lost and soon obsolete. Already I struggle to find a computer to read a CD. Will I still have them in 5 years? 10? 20? How about my son, will he have them in 50?

Other people trust them to social media, hoping that those memories will live on at the pleasure of a company which owes them nothing. How many photos vanished with Friends Reunited? With AOL boards? How many more will vanish with Instagram or Facebook when the next big thing arrives?

Even if I find a way to keep my photos, how many will end up as blanks, unreadable with current technology? How many will be 78s in a world of streaming and digital playback?

# Towards Digital Permanence

I looked at the cleverest solutions I could find. Peer to peer distributed file systems, blockchain storage, on and on. After a while, I reached a conclusion. The answer is in the organisation charged with keeping digital memories safe. The answer is in its remit, its ethos, its constitution.

Technology will change over time, with increasing disruption and rapidity. The answer lies not in a new type of technology, but in **a new type of technology company**.

Eternity will be a technology company focused on the long term. It will make decisions for the long term and put resilience, sustainability and risk-aversion ahead of quick profits and user numbers. In many ways, it is as old-fashioned as companies can be, relying on building trust and quietly providing a service of reassurance. It will need to grow, to adapt, to keep pace with the world -- but it will do so **in service of its customers**, not in thrall to disruption and upheaval.

In the next posts I'll talk more about what I think that looks like practically, about how to use the technologies we have today as a starting point, and how to ensure that a company can live for centuries.
