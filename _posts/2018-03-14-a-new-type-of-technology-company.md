title: A New Type of Technology Company
---

I ended the previous post with my belief that the problem of long term digital storage lies in **a new type of technology company**. I want to talk about some of the things that make that company different.

# Elements of Eternity

## Simplicity

Technology is complex, but aiming for simplicity usually leads in the right direction. Complex systems are brittle and prone to unexpected failure modes. The same applies to companies.

If you look at a list of the oldest companies in the world which exist today, they usually share one thing. Their business model is truly simple. Sure, they will all have complexities of their own. Details and nuances and challenges which make the operation of the business complex. Yet their beating heart is a simple business model.

* **Make paper. Sell it.**
* **Build rooms. Charge people to stay in them, eat, drink.**
* **Construct buildings. Sell them.**

Eternity will -- must -- follow this example. No complex multi-layered business models. No hidden monetization strategy. No blurring of the lines between customer and product.

In short, the simple model of Eternity is this: **Store digital memories – keep them safe and accessible for generations. Charge a fair and sustainable amount to do so.**

## Sustainability

The word “sustainable” is no accident in that model. No clever technology can ever outweigh the impact of a company failing. Eternity must be sustainable. It must be profitable with just the income from customers. No “volume now, money later”. No “cheap/free subsidised by advertising or by selling user data”.

The most sustainable model for Eternity is to charge a fair price. A price which covers costs, ensuring the company is profitable in the long term. This is the best chance any company has to last. Stay simple. Stay sustainable.

## Transparency

Being open about the business model of a company is not enough. For a company to gain the trust needed to survive across generations it must embrace transparency. Risk perception, mitigation, and long term strategy must be open and meaningful to customers. To ask for trust without these elements would be meaningless.

One of the challenges of Eternity will be to predict risk. To plan for risk, to move early.  To have a plan A. And a plan B. And C. And D… Eternity must be able to give people reason to trust. It cannot do so with secrecy.

# Next

These high level elements form the base for all the principles which will guide Eternity. If there is ever doubt, these will be the guidelines for Eternity as a business.

I’ll be writing next about how technology must fit within this business model. I'll give my thoughts about the initial iteration of Eternity as technology.
